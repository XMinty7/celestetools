# About

This document attempts to explain Seeker states and their behavior.
The explanation is coupled with references to values a [Beta Build of CelesteTAS](https://github.com/EverestAPI/CelesteTAS-EverestInterop/suites/12114543885/artifacts/638447220) displays.

# Notes

Measurements are given in tiles for ease of interpretation, the game always checks values in pixels.
Exclusive tile distances exclude only the furthest point of the furthest tile, not the entire tile and not the further pixel.
When comparing the position of the seeker to the position of the player (e.g. distance check), the center of the hitbox of both is assumed to be the point of reference unless specified otherwise.
Acceleration is denoted in $\mathrm{px/s^2}$. The value in $\mathrm{px/s/frame}$ changes depending on the time rate as the game multiplies the constant value in $\mathrm{px/s^2}$ by delta time.

# Values

## `canSeePlayer`
`canSeePlayer` is continuously updated on each frame to reflect whether the player is in sight of the seeker or not.

Let:
* $p$ be the center of the player
* $c$ be the center of the seeker
- $u$ be the vector from the center of the seeker to the center of the player: $u=p-c$
- $v$ be the vector perpendicular to $u$ and two pixels long
* Segments of sight $s_1$ and $s_2$ be the line segments between pairs of points $(p+v, c+v)$ and $(p-v, c-v)$ respectively

`canSeePlayer` is true if and only if:
1. The player exists in the level (e.g. not dead)
2. At least one of three conditions is satisfied:
	- The state is `StSpotted`
	- The center of the seeker $c$ is within the rectangle formed by the camer bounds
	- The distance from the seeker to the player satisfies $||u||<=20$ tiles 
3. Both segments of sight $s_1, s_2$ don't intersect any solids
4. The state is not `StRegenerate`

## `lastSpottedAt`
`lastSpottedAt` is updated every frame `canSeePlayer` is true to the current player position. Meaning, it reflects the last position the player was seen at.
When `lastSpottedAt` changes, the seeker runs the pathfinding algorithm to attempt to generate a movement path towards it. If the pathfinding algorithm fails, a flag is stored to indicate that.

## `FollowTarget`
`FollowTarget` is always two pixels higher than `lastSpottedAt`.

## `spotted`
`spotted` is set to true every frame `canSeePlayer` is true, but never reset to false. Meaning, it indicates whether the seeker is aware of the player's of presence or not (having seen the player once before or not).

## `CanAttack`
`CanAttack` is not updated continuously, but can be calculated on any given frame. Its value reflects whether the seeker can begin the attack dash or not.

`CanAttack` is true if and only if:
1. The player is within 3 tiles of the seeker vertically (inclusive)
2. The player is further than 2 tiles of the seeker horizontally (inclusive)
3. The angle between the center of the seeker and `FollowTarget` is less than or equal to 30Â° degrees from the horizon, as demonstrated in the diagram below (blue passes the check, red does not): ![[seekerattackangle.png]]

## `GetSpeedMagnitude`
`GetSpeedMagnitude` is a routine that can be evaluated to determine the target magnitude of the speed vector. It takes a base magnitude $b$, and returns the first applicable value of the following:
1. If the player does not exist in the scene, return $b$ (the base magnitude as-is)
2. If the player is within 14 tiles (inclusive) of the seeker, return $1.5b$
3. Return $3b$
Note that `GetSpeedMagnitude` operates on the current position of the player, not on `lastSpottedAt` or `FollowTarget`.
This means that for the states that use `GetSpeedMagnitude` to determine the speed, it is possible to manipulate the seeker into moving faster by maintaining a distance greater than 14 tiles from it.

## Patrol points
Some seekers have nodes placed in their map data. Those nodes act as patrol points of sorts, randomly chosen ones of which the seeker continuously goes to.

# States

## `StIdle`
`StIdle` is the initial state for newly spawned seekers, and the default for when seekers don't know what to do.
`StIdle` can transition to `StPatrol` and `StSpotted`.

Update algorithm for `StIdle` is as follows:
- If `canSeePlayer` is true, change the state to `StSpotted` and stop execution.
- Set the target speed vector per default to a sinewave movement pattern (cosmetic idle animation)
- If `spotted` is true AND `FollowTarget` is more than a tile away:
	- Evaluate `GetSpeedMagnitude` with a base magnitude of 50 and set the result as the target speed magnitude
	- If pathfinding succeeded for `lastSpottedAt`, set the target speed direction tangential to the current segment of the path. Otherwise, set the direction to be directly towards `FollowTarget`.
- Change the speed vector towards the target speed vector by a maximum magnitude of 200 $\mathrm{px/s^2}$

Takeaways:
- `StSpotted` is entered as soon as the seeker first sees the player.
- While the player isn't in sight, seekers will always move towards the last seen player position while in `StIdle` (they do that if `spotted` is true and it must be if the player has been seen before).
- Seekers can overshoot the segment of the path they're moving on and have to decelerate then accelerate back towards the next segment.
- The optimal way to move seekers while in `StIdle` is to stay more than 14 tiles away to trigger the high speed condition in `GetSpeedMagnitude`.


## `StPatrol`
`StPatrol` is the state that indicates the seeker is aware of the player's presence but cannot find them. When the seeker is in this state, it tries to randomly patrol around predetermined points called [Patrol Points](Seekers%20and%20seeker%20states#Patrol%20points)
