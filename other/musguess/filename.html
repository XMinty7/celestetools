            How to play:<br>
            - Upload a ZIP containing properly named/tagged mp3 files to the file input - the website will read them immediately on upload, and the file will be preserved if you reload the page<br>
            - Set the randomization seed to get the same songs as your opponents, click apply to reset the RNG and set the seed, you will get an alert with a random string of 10 alphanumeric characters generated from the seed to confirm with your opponents<br>
            - Count down, and click play to have the website choose and play a random song - a guessing timer will begin, try to guess the title of the song and write down your guess in the respective text input - when done, press enter or click the reveal button to finalize your guess<br>
            - Once the guessing is done, the correct answer is revealed, and the timer is stopped, share a screenshot of your time and guess with your opponents, the most accurate guess in the smallest time period wins the round (priority to guess accuracy)<br>
            - A screenshot will be automatically copied to your clipboard after each guess unless you are on Firefox and you haven't enabled the ClipBoard API in <a href="about:config" target="_blank">Browser Preferences</a>, in which case a new tab is opened containing the screenshot, from which it can be copied.<br>
            - The winner of each round should manually increase their score using the plus button - the minus button can be used to adjust the score if overshot<br>
            - The volume, play and pause buttons can be used to control the music player
